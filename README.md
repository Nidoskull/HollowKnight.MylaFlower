# HollowKnight.MylaFlower

Mod that allows you to protect Myla from dying if you bring her the delicate flower.
- If you do not have Cdash, then there will be no change to the vanilla behaviour.
- You can still kill Myla if you do not have the delicate flower when you visit her.
- Once you have given Myla the flower, she will no longer be infected.

Thanks to
- Miikarin for making the myla flower spritesheet
- Gidge for writing the dialogue
